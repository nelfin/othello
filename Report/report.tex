  \label{abstract}
  An agent to play the board game Othello is created, with the ability
  to learn through reinforcement. The minimax algorithm is used for game
  playing, and a static evaluation function for the leaf nodes is learnt by
  self play.  The agent learns the insignificance of the number of stones, and
  the significance of stone positioning. This agent is played against itself,
  and against other developed agents, and its performance is analysed.

\section{Problem overview}
\label{sec:problem_overview}
%%Describe the game and the nature of the task
In this project we were tasked with the challenge of developing a learning
agent to play a variant of the game Othello. Othello is a two-player zero-sum
game traditionally played on an 8$\times$8 board with players alternately
placing stones so as to capture lines laid down by their opponent, reversing
the colour of the intermediate discs in the process.
In this variant the game will be played on a 10$\times$10 board with four
squares chosen to be blocked. These four squares are randomly determined at
the beginning of each match, and are not allowed to be one of the
locations of the four initial stones.

To this end, we were provided with a sample implementation of an Othello
server and simple client code in C++. Our subsequent task was to implement an
agent to generate the game tree for Othello from an arbitrary state to a
certain depth, evaluate these states using a static evaluation function, then
use minimax back-propagation to chose the most appropriate move which it would
then communicate to the server.

\section{Learning}
\label{sec:learning}

After developing a static evaluation function, the next task became that of
learning the optimal weights for each feature that would provide us the with
the strongest play. We considered and implemented two strategies for learning
these weights: Temporal Difference learning as \tdl, and a genetic algorithm
using Elo scores as a fitness metric.

\subsection{\tdl}
\label{sub:tdlambda}

The \tdl\ algorithm was used to learn the weighting of the static evaluation
function's various features. \tdl\ was first described by \citet{Sutton1988}
in his seminal paper on the topic. The implementation of this algorithm is
based on the one implemented by the KnightCap agent as described by
\citet{Baxter1997}.  At the end of each game played, the agent adjusts its
weights according to the following formula:

\begin{center}

    $\displaystyle w := w + \alpha \sum _{t=1} ^{N-1} \Delta \tilde{J}(x_t,w) \: \times \: \Big[ \sum ^ {N-1} _{j=t} \lambda^{j-t} d_t \Big] $\\
        
    \begin{tabular}{  l l | l l }
      $w$                   & The vector of weights                         &$x_t$  & The $t^{th}$ board in the game \\
      $\alpha$              & The learning rate                             &$\lambda$      &The discount factor \\
      $N$                   & The number of states in the game              &$d_t$          &$\tilde{J}(x_{t+1},w) - \tilde{J}(x_t,w)$\\
      $\Delta \tilde{J}$    & The derivative of the $\tilde{J}$ function    &               &\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the above formula, the $\tilde{J}$ function estimates the probability of
winning from a given state, given a set of weights for features and our board.
It approximates the $J$ function, \\

\begin{center}
$
J(x_t) = \begin{cases} 1, & \mbox{if } x_t\mbox{ is a winning state} \\ 0, & \mbox{if } x_t\mbox{ is a lost state} \end{cases}
$
\end{center}

For each game state $x_t$, we adjust the weights according to a factor $d_t$,
which is the temporal difference. $d_t = \tilde{J}(x_{t+1},w) -
\tilde{J}(x_t,w)$, and the weight adjustment is scaled with this amount. The
key observation is, for the true $J$ function, $J(x_{t+1}) - J(x_t) = 0$, so
we adjust our weights relative to this amount.

From Figure~\ref{fig:learned_j}, we can see that the
$\tilde{J}$ function, while not accurate for the entirety of the game, is able
to predict the results within the last 20 moves. In comparison,
Figure~\ref{fig:initial_j} indicates that the $\tilde{J}$ function
initially is a bad approximation, as even after losing a game, the estimated
probability of winning is high.

In Figure \ref{LearningProgress}, we can see the progress of the learning
agent as it plays against a fixed opponent. After about 1000 games, the agent
settles on a win/loss ratio of approximately 0.7. 
%The weights learnt were
%split into 20 stages. Figure \ref{WeightsOverTime} shows the how highly the
%various features are weighted as a game progresses. We see that the `Legal
%Moves' feature is weighted highly early in the game, and later in the game,
%valued less. On the other hand, corner pieces and side pieces become more
%important as we approach the mid and end game. This makes sense, as the number
%of legal moves on the board is limited later in the game, and it is unlikely
%that a side or corner piece will be taken in the first quarter of the game.

\subsection{Staged Learning}
\label{sec:staging}

Jafar performs \tdl\ learning in \emph{stages}. Each stage defines a separate
set of feature weights for a certain number of moves in the game. This allows
the agent to play with alternate strategies at different points throughout the
game; for example playing conservatively and leaving options open early game
and changing to a greedier nature near the end. In the most extreme case we
can split the agent into 92 game stages; maintaining a different set of
feature weights for every move of the game.  Note however that each stage we
add to the agent corresponds to a linear increase in the number of parameters
\tdl\ must learn; possibly leading to an exponential increase in convergence
time for the algorithm.  In Figure~\ref{WeightsOverTime} and
Figure~\ref{WeightsOverTime92} below we see show the feature weights
throughout the game for a 20-stage and 92-stage version of Jafar; with \tdl\
run over 1000 and 30000 games respectively.

Notice that the two graphs are for the most part very similar; we see all the
same trends in both (though the 92-stage agent shows these trends in greater
detail). Note that the 20-stage agent has been running for a thirtieth the
amount of time that the 92-stage agent has; and the fact that the results are
similar reflects our above intuition regarding the increase in learning time
required.

Notice the excessive `zig-zagging' present in both graphs (more notably in the
92-stage agent). This effect occurs due to the \emph{parity} of the board:
optimal play style differs slightly depending on whether or not the
agent will take the last move of the game. This effect is still observable in
the 20-stage agent since the stages have a differing amount of odd and even
parity moves.
