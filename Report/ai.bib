@article{Sutton1988,
abstract = {This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction---that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage.},

We present some ex- periments in which our chess program, “KnightCap,” used TDLeaf($\lambda$) to learn its evaluation function while playing on the Free Ineternet Chess Server (FICS, fics.onenet.net). It improved from a 1650 rating to a 2100 rating in just 308 games and 3 days of play. We discuss some of the reasons for this success and also the relationship between our results and Tesauro’s results in backgammon.},
